	        <h2>Why do I study HTML and CSS</h2>
        <p> I study HTML and CSSto further my understanding of technology and websites. When you get deep enough into it it starts feeling less like stresful work and moreso like art</p>
	        <h2>Coding fundamentals</h2>
        
	        <p>
	            I gained an introduction to coding that changed the way I look at websites now. Every single piece of a wbeiste  has hours and hours of work put into a single line  of code makes one appreciate those who worked on it.

	        <h2>Value</h2>
	        <p>
	           The further into the future we go technology will only continue to become more complicated, and understanding it will bring people in high demand when it comes to jobs. Why wouldn't someone want to put themselves ahead of their peers in the understanding of the growing future.
